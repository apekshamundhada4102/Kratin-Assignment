        <p><b>HeartCare</b> In this digital world, data is an asset, and enormous data was generated in all the fields. Data in the healthcare industry consists of all the information related to patients. Now day’s cardiovascular diseases are growing rapidly by busy and stress full life. All type of age groups is under the threat of these chronic diseases so there is a need of detection of these diseases by using symptoms or reports. Early identification and treatment are the best available option for the infected people. Main objective behind to develop a system is to help the doctors to cross verify their diagnosed results which gives promising solution over existing death rates.
            The recent development in medical supportive technologies based on data mining, deep learning plays an important role in detecting cardiovascular diseases that are caused by taking many factors in consideration such as age, type of chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.<br>
            By using our proposed work try to implement a promising solution for detection of heart disease.

                            •XgBoost: XgBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. In prediction problems involving unstructured data (images, text, etc.) artificial neural networks tend to outperform all other algorithms or frameworks. However, when it comes to small-to-medium structured/tabular data, decision tree-based algorithms are considered best-in-class right now.<br>
• Random Forest: Random Forest, like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes become our model’s prediction.<br>
• Classification and Regression Trees: CART is a predictive algorithm used in machine learning. It explains how a target variable's values can be predicted based on other values. It is a decision tree where each fork is split in a predictor variable and each node at the end has a prediction for the target variable.<br>

                    The artificial intelligence (AI) technologies becoming ever present in modern business and
                    everyday
                    life is
                    also steadily being applied to healthcare. The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare has
                    the
                    potential to assist healthcare providers in many aspects of patient care and administrative
                    processes. Most
                    AI and healthcare technologies have strong relevance to the healthcare field, but the tactics
                    they
                    support
                    can vary significantly. And while some articles on artificial intelligence in healthcare suggest
                    that the
                    use of artificial intelligence in healthcare can perform just as well or better than humans at
                    certain
                    procedures, such as diagnosing disease, it will be a significant number of years before AI in
                    healthcare
                    replaces humans for a broad range of medical tasks.

                    Machine learning is one of the most common forms of artificial intelligence in healthcare. It is
                    a
                    broad technique at the core of many approaches to AI and healthcare technology and there are
                    many
                    versions of it.
                    Using artificial intelligence in healthcare, the most widespread utilization of traditional
                    machine
                    learning is precision medicine. Being able to predict what treatment procedures are likely to be
                    successful
                    with patients based on their make-up and the treatment framework is a huge leap forward for many
                    healthcare organizations. The majority of AI in healthcare that uses machine learning and
                    precision
                    medicine applications require data for training, for which the end result is known. This is
                    known as
                    supervised learning.
